# Tetris
Tetris created in Java.

## Description
  This is tetris, created in Java using Java Swing. It has two panels, the Game Panel where the actual game takes place and the Side Panel where the score of the player, the level of difficulty and the controls are displayed. 
  The score of player is the sum of the points gotten from each cleared line (one line = 100 pts, two lines = 200 pts, three lines = 300 pts, four lines = 400 pts).
  After each piece/tetromino, that was added to the Game Panel, the game's speed gets slightly faster. The level of the game is based on this game speed.
